# Youtube Clone

This project is a clone of the popular video-sharing platform YouTube, developed as a part of Akshay Saini's Namaste React course. It is built using modern front-end technologies, including React, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS, and other libraries.


## Getting Started


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
## Features

YouTube Video List: The app displays a paginated list of YouTube videos fetched from the YouTube API. The list supports lazy loading to enhance performance

YouTube Video Preview: Clicking on a video in the list opens a preview window that displays the selected video. The preview window includes basic details of the video, such as its title, description, and view count

Search Suggestions: As the user types in the search bar, the app displays a dropdown list of suggested search queries. This feature enhances the user experience and makes it easier to find relevant videos

Optimized Search Using Caching and Debouncing: The app uses debouncing to optimize the search functionality. This means that instead of making an API call for every key press in the search bar, the app waits until the user has stopped typing before making the API call. Additionally, the app uses caching to fetch the results of previous searches faster.

 Live Chat of YouTube - Get Data Live, Update UI Continuously Developed with API Polling: The app includes a live chat feature that allows users to view and send messages in real-time. The chat is implemented using API polling, which means that the app regularly makes API calls to fetch new messages and updates the UI accordingly.
